  summary: |-
    'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Armadillo' Templated Linear Algebra
    Library
  description: |-
    'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by
    Conrad Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between
    speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point and complex
    numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and
    statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
    provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS
    libraries.  The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header
    files from the templated 'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not
    need to install 'Armadillo' itself in order to use
    'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is
    licensed under Apache License 2; previous releases were under
    licensed as MPL 2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3
    prior to that; 'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to
    Armadillo) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as
    is the rest of 'Rcpp'.
